# Conversant-Codeing-Challenge
I wrote this on a python Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 on sagemath cloud. You should be able to run this in any jupyter notebook or python editor
I will include the jupyter notebook file and the code for copy/paste into an editor.
I was able to find the mean and standard deviation of the values for each data center.
I graphed the Values in relation to the Time for the first 25 rows 
Some challenges I faced was trying to figure out what the data was representing so I wasn't sure what to analyze.
I hope this will suffice and I look forward learning as much as I can for this position
